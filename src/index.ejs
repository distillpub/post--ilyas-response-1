        <p>
            The hypothesis in Ilyas et. al. is a special case of a more general principle that is well accepted in the
            distributional robustness literature—models lack robustness to distribution shift because they latch onto
            superficial correlations in the data. Naturally, the same principle also explains adversarial examples
            because they arise from a worst-case analysis of distribution shift. To obtain a more complete understanding
            of robustness, adversarial example researchers should connect their work to the more general problem of
            distributional robustness rather than remaining solely fixated on small gradient perturbations.

        <h2>Detailed Response</h2>

        <p>
            The main hypothesis in Ilyas et al. (2019) happens to be a special case of a more general principle that is
            commonly accepted in the robustness to distributional shift literature <d-cite key="c4,c9,c10,c11,c12">
            </d-cite>: a model's lack of
            robustness is largely because the model latches onto superficial statistics in the data. In the image
            domain, these statistics may be unused by—and unintuitive to—humans, yet they may be useful for
            generalization in i.i.d. settings. Separate experiments eschewing gradient perturbations and studying
            robustness beyond adversarial perturbations show similar results. For example, a recent work <d-cite
                key="c1"></d-cite>
            demonstrates that models can generalize to the test examples by learning from high-frequency information
            that is both naturally occurring and also inconspicuous. Concretely, models were trained and tested with an
            extreme high-pass filter applied to the data. The resulting high-frequency features appear completely
            grayscale to humans, yet models are able to achieve 50% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K solely from these
            natural features that usually are "invisible." These hard-to-notice features can be made conspicuous by
            normalizing the filtered image to have unit variance pixel statistics in the figure below.
        </p>

                Models can achieve high accuracy using information from the input that would be unrecognizable
                to humans. Shown above are models trained and tested with aggressive high and low pass filtering applied
                to the inputs. With aggressive low-pass filtering, the model is still above 30% on ImageNet when the
                images appear to be simple globs of color. In the case of high-pass (HP) filtering, models can achieve
                above 50% accuracy using features in the input that are nearly invisible to humans. As shown on the
                right hand side, the high pass filtered images needed be normalized in order to properly visualize the
                high frequency features.

        <p>
            Given the plethora of useful correlations that exist in natural data, we should expect that our models will
            learn to exploit them. However, models relying on superficial statistics can poorly generalize should these
            same statistics become corrupted after deployment. To obtain a more complete understanding of model
            robustness, <d-cite key="c1"></d-cite> measured test error after perturbing every image in the test set by a
            Fourier basis vector,
            as shown in Figure 2. The naturally trained model is robust to low-frequency perturbations, but,
            interestingly, lacks robustness in the mid to high frequencies. In contrast, adversarial training improves
            robustness to mid- and high-frequency perturbations, while sacrificing performance on low frequency
            perturbations. For instance adversarial training degrades performance on the low-frequency fog corruption
            <d-cite key="c4"></d-cite> from 85.7% to 55.3%. Adversarial training similarly degrades robustness to
            contrast and low-pass
            filtered noise. By taking a broader view of robustness beyond tiny $\ell_p$ norm perturbations, we discover
            that adversarially trained models are actually not "robust." They are instead biased towards different kinds
            of superficial statistics. As a result, adversarial training can sacrifice robustness in real-world
            settings.

                Model sensitivity to additive noise aligned with different Fourier basis vectors on CIFAR-10.
                We fix the additive noise to have $\ell_2$ norm 4 and evaluate three models: a naturally trained model,
                an
                adversarially trained model, and a model trained with Gaussian data augmentation. Error rates are
                averaged over 1000 randomly sampled images from the test set. In the bottom row we show images perturbed
                with noise along the corresponding Fourier basis vector. The naturally trained model is highly sensitive
                to additive noise in all but the lowest frequencies. Both adversarial training and Gaussian data
                augmentation dramatically improve robustness in the higher frequencies while sacrificing the robustness
                of the naturally trained model in the lowest frequencies (i.e. in both models, blue area in the middle
                is smaller compared to that of the naturally trained model).

        <p>
            How, then, can the research community create models that robustly generalize in the real world, given that
            adversarial training can harm robustness to distributional shift? To do so, the research community must take
            a broader view of robustness and accept that $\ell_p$ adversarial robustness is highly limited and mostly
            detached from security and real-world robustness <d-cite key="c13"></d-cite>. While often thought an
            idiosyncratic quirk of deep
            neural network classifiers, adversarial examples are not a counterintuitive mystery plaguing otherwise
            superhuman classifiers. Instead, adversarial examples are in fact expected of models which lack robustness
            to noise <d-cite key="c2,c3"></d-cite>. They should not be surprising given the brittleness observed in
            numerous synthetic—and even
            natural <d-cite key="c15"></d-cite>—conditions. Models reliably exhibit poor performance when they are
            evaluated on distributions
            slightly different from the training distribution. For all that, current benchmarks do not expose these
            failure modes. The upshot is that we need to design harder and more diverse test sets, and we should not
            continue to be singularly fixated on studying specific gradient perturbations. As we move forward in
            robustness research, we should focus on the various ways in which models are fragile, and design more
            comprehensive benchmarks accordingly <d-cite key="c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c14,c15"></d-cite>. As long as models lack
            robustness to
            distributional shift, there will always be errors to find adversarially.
